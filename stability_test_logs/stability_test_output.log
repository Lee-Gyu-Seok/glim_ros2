[2025-12-05 03:12:24.322] [global] [error] an indeterminant lienar system exception was caught during global map optimization!!
[2025-12-05 03:12:24.322] [global] [error] 
Indeterminant linear system detected while working near variable
8646911284551352345 (Symbol: x25).

Thrown when a linear system is ill-posed.  The most common cause for this
error is having underconstrained variables.  Mathematically, the system is
underdetermined.  See the GTSAM Doxygen documentation at
http://borg.cc.gatech.edu/ on gtsam::IndeterminantLinearSystemException for
more information.

[2025-12-05 03:12:24.642] [global] [error] an indeterminant lienar system exception was caught during global map optimization!!
[2025-12-05 03:12:24.642] [global] [error] 
Indeterminant linear system detected while working near variable
8646911284551352320 (Symbol: x0).

Thrown when a linear system is ill-posed.  The most common cause for this
error is having underconstrained variables.  Mathematically, the system is
underdetermined.  See the GTSAM Doxygen documentation at
http://borg.cc.gatech.edu/ on gtsam::IndeterminantLinearSystemException for
more information.

[2025-12-05 03:12:28.346] [global] [error] an indeterminant lienar system exception was caught during global map optimization!!
[2025-12-05 03:12:28.346] [global] [error] 
Indeterminant linear system detected while working near variable
8646911284551352346 (Symbol: x26).

Thrown when a linear system is ill-posed.  The most common cause for this
error is having underconstrained variables.  Mathematically, the system is
underdetermined.  See the GTSAM Doxygen documentation at
http://borg.cc.gatech.edu/ on gtsam::IndeterminantLinearSystemException for
more information.

[2025-12-05 03:12:32.129] [global] [error] 
Indeterminant linear system detected while working near variable
8646911284551352346 (Symbol: x26).

Thrown when a linear system is ill-posed.  The most common cause for this
error is having underconstrained variables.  Mathematically, the system is
underdetermined.  See the GTSAM Doxygen documentation at
http://borg.cc.gatech.edu/ on gtsam::IndeterminantLinearSystemException for
more information.

[2025-12-05 03:12:35.912] [global] [error] an indeterminant lienar system exception was caught during global map optimization!!
[2025-12-05 03:12:35.912] [global] [error] 
Indeterminant linear system detected while working near variable
8646911284551352346 (Symbol: x26).

Thrown when a linear system is ill-posed.  The most common cause for this
error is having underconstrained variables.  Mathematically, the system is
underdetermined.  See the GTSAM Doxygen documentation at
http://borg.cc.gatech.edu/ on gtsam::IndeterminantLinearSystemException for
more information.

underdetermined.  See the GTSAM Doxygen documentation at

[2025-12-05 03:12:40.164] [global] [error] 
Indeterminant linear system detected while working near variable
8646911284551352347 (Symbol: x27).

Thrown when a linear system is ill-posed.  The most common cause for this
error is having underconstrained variables.  Mathematically, the system is
underdetermined.  See the GTSAM Doxygen documentation at
http://borg.cc.gatech.edu/ on gtsam::IndeterminantLinearSystemException for
more information.

[2025-12-05 03:12:43.973] [global] [error] 
Indeterminant linear system detected while working near variable
8646911284551352347 (Symbol: x27).

Thrown when a linear system is ill-posed.  The most common cause for this
error is having underconstrained variables.  Mathematically, the system is
underdetermined.  See the GTSAM Doxygen documentation at
http://borg.cc.gatech.edu/ on gtsam::IndeterminantLinearSystemException for
more information.

[2025-12-05 03:12:47.439] [global] [error] an indeterminant lienar system exception was caught during global map optimization!!
[2025-12-05 03:12:47.439] [global] [error] 
Indeterminant linear system detected while working near variable
8646911284551352347 (Symbol: x27).

Thrown when a linear system is ill-posed.  The most common cause for this
error is having underconstrained variables.  Mathematically, the system is
underdetermined.  See the GTSAM Doxygen documentation at
http://borg.cc.gatech.edu/ on gtsam::IndeterminantLinearSystemException for
more information.

underdetermined.  See the GTSAM Doxygen documentation at

[2025-12-05 03:12:51.689] [global] [error] an indeterminant lienar system exception was caught during global map optimization!!
[2025-12-05 03:12:51.689] [global] [error] 
Indeterminant linear system detected while working near variable
8646911284551352346 (Symbol: x26).

Thrown when a linear system is ill-posed.  The most common cause for this
error is having underconstrained variables.  Mathematically, the system is
underdetermined.  See the GTSAM Doxygen documentation at
http://borg.cc.gatech.edu/ on gtsam::IndeterminantLinearSystemException for
more information.

[2025-12-05 03:12:55.734] [global] [error] an indeterminant lienar system exception was caught during global map optimization!!
[2025-12-05 03:12:55.734] [global] [error] 
Indeterminant linear system detected while working near variable
8646911284551352346 (Symbol: x26).

Thrown when a linear system is ill-posed.  The most common cause for this
error is having underconstrained variables.  Mathematically, the system is
underdetermined.  See the GTSAM Doxygen documentation at
http://borg.cc.gatech.edu/ on gtsam::IndeterminantLinearSystemException for
more information.

[2025-12-05 03:12:59.789] [global] [error] an indeterminant lienar system exception was caught during global map optimization!!
[2025-12-05 03:12:59.789] [global] [error] 
Indeterminant linear system detected while working near variable
8646911284551352346 (Symbol: x26).

Thrown when a linear system is ill-posed.  The most common cause for this
error is having underconstrained variables.  Mathematically, the system is
underdetermined.  See the GTSAM Doxygen documentation at
http://borg.cc.gatech.edu/ on gtsam::IndeterminantLinearSystemException for
more information.

underdetermined.  See the GTSAM Doxygen documentation at

[2025-12-05 03:13:04.391] [global] [error] an indeterminant lienar system exception was caught during global map optimization!!
[2025-12-05 03:13:04.391] [global] [error] 
Indeterminant linear system detected while working near variable
8646911284551352349 (Symbol: x29).

Thrown when a linear system is ill-posed.  The most common cause for this
error is having underconstrained variables.  Mathematically, the system is
underdetermined.  See the GTSAM Doxygen documentation at
http://borg.cc.gatech.edu/ on gtsam::IndeterminantLinearSystemException for
more information.

[2025-12-05 03:13:08.527] [global] [error] an indeterminant lienar system exception was caught during global map optimization!!
[2025-12-05 03:13:08.528] [global] [error] 
Indeterminant linear system detected while working near variable
8646911284551352349 (Symbol: x29).

Thrown when a linear system is ill-posed.  The most common cause for this
error is having underconstrained variables.  Mathematically, the system is
underdetermined.  See the GTSAM Doxygen documentation at
http://borg.cc.gatech.edu/ on gtsam::IndeterminantLinearSystemException for
more information.
